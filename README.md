# Obsidian Youtube Thumbnails
This plugin lets you insert video thumbnails into your notes to help you keep track of what you're actually linking.

Works with Youtube and Vimeo.

## Usage
Place a code block with the `vidy` type, and include the link to your video:
````markdown
```vidy
https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ
```
````
*OR* use the "Insert from clipboard" command (bit faster)
## Commands
### Insert thumbnail from URL in clipboard
If you have a video URL in your clipboard, this command will create the code block for you.

### Insert video title link from URL in clipboard
If you have a video URL in your clipboard, this command will automatically create a link with the text set to the video title.
